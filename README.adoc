Redis SQL Trino is a SQL interface for https://redis.io/docs/stack/[Redis Stack], https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/[Redis Cloud], and https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/[Redis Enterprise].

Trino is a distributed SQL engine designed to query large data sets distributed over one or more heterogeneous data sources. The Redis SQL Trino connector lets you use Trino to query your Redis data using SQL.

This implementation leverages the indexing and querying capabilites of Redis Stack. As such, this connector generally outperforms the https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/redis.html[OSS Redis Trino connector], which cannot take advantage of these indexed queries.

== Background

Redis is an in-memory data store designed to serve data with the fastest possible response times. For this reason, Redis is frequently used for caching OLTP-style application queries. Redis Stack is an extension to Redis that, among other things, lets you index your data and then efficiently query it using a custom query language.

We built the Redis SQL Trino connector so that you can query Redis using SQL. This is useful for any application compatible with JDBC. For example, Redis SQL Trino lets you query and visualize your Redis data from Tableau.

== Quick start

To understand how Redis SQL Trino works, it's best to try it for yourself. View the screen recording or follow the steps below:

image::https://asciinema.org/a/526185.svg[asciicast,link=https://asciinema.org/a/526185]

First, clone this git repository:
[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
git clone {project-url}.git
cd {project-name}
----

Next, use Docker Compose to launch containers for Trino and Redis Stack:
[source,console]
----
docker-compose up
----

This example uses a small data set describing a collection of beers. To load the data set, you'll need to have https://developer.redis.com/riot/riot-file/index.html[riot-file] installed locally (see the https://developer.redis.com/riot/riot-file/index.html[riot-file] installation instructions).

Next, use `riot-file` to import the sample data set into Redis:
[source,console]
----
riot-file -h localhost import https://storage.googleapis.com/jrx/beers.json \
  hset --keyspace beer --keys id
----

Each beer is represented as a Redis hash. Start the Redis CLI to examine this data. For example, here's how you can view the "Beer Town Brown" record:
[source,console]
----
docker exec -it redis /opt/redis-stack/bin/redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall beer:190
----

Next, create an index on the beer data. While still in the Redis CLI, you can create the required index by running the following `FT.CREATE` command:
[source,console]
----
127.0.0.1:6379> FT.CREATE beers ON HASH PREFIX 1 beer: SCHEMA id TAG SORTABLE \ 
  brewery_id TAG SORTABLE name TEXT SORTABLE abv NUMERIC SORTABLE descript TEXT \ 
  style_name TAG SORTABLE cat_name TAG SORTABLE
----

Now that you've indexed the data set, you can query it using SQL statements through Trino. Start the Trino CLI:
[source,console]
----
docker exec -it trino trino --catalog redisearch --schema default
----

View "Beer Town Brown" using SQL:
[source,console]
----
trino:default> select * from beers where id = '190';
----

Show all beers with an ABV greater than 3.2%:
[source,console]
----
trino:default> select * from beers where abv > 3.2 order by abv desc;
----

== Installation

To run Redis SQL Trino in production, you'll need Trino, a copy of the Redis SQL Trino connector, and a https://redis.io/docs/stack/[Redis Stack], https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/[Redis Cloud], and https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/[Redis Enterprise] deployment.

=== Trino

First, you'll need a working Trino installation. 

See the https://trino.io/docs/current/installation.html[Trino installation and deplyoment guide] for details. Trino recommends a https://trino.io/docs/current/installation/containers.html[container-based deployment] using your orchestration platform of choice. If you run Kubernetes, see the https://trino.io/docs/current/installation/kubernetes.html[Trino Helm chart].

=== Redis SQL Trino Connector

Next, you'll need to install the Redis SQL Trino plugin and configure it. See our documentation for https://redis-field-engineering.github.io/redis-sql/#redisearch-connector[plugin installation] and https://redis-field-engineering.github.io/redis-sql/#configuration[plugin configuration].

=== Redis installation

For a self-managed deployment, or for testing locally, install https://redis.io/docs/stack/[Redis Stack]. If you need a fully-managed, cloud-based deployment of Redis on AWS, GCP, or Azure, see https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/[Redis Cloud]. For deployment in your own private cloud or data center, consider https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/[Redis Enterprise].

== Usage

The example above uses the https://trino.io/docs/current/client/cli.html[Trino CLI] to access your data.

Most real world applications will use the https://trino.io/docs/current/client/jdbc.html[Trino JDBC driver] to issue queries. See the https://redis-field-engineering.github.io/redis-sql/#clients[Redis SQL Trino] documentation for details.

== Support

Redis SQL Trino is supported by Redis, Inc. on a good faith effort basis. To report bugs, request features, or receive assistance, please {project-url}/issues[file an issue].
